# VexMail Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The VexMail application has been successfully refactored to use SQLite for the database and local file storage for attachments, removing dependencies on PostgreSQL and cloud storage services.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Configuration
- **File**: `app.py`, `env.example`
- **Change**: Updated database configuration from PostgreSQL to SQLite
- **Details**: 
  - Changed `DATABASE_URL` from `postgresql://...` to `sqlite:///instance/vexmail.db`
  - Updated default database URI in app.py

### 2. Storage System
- **File**: `storage_client.py` (completely rewritten)
- **Change**: Replaced S3/MinIO storage with local file system storage
- **Details**:
  - Created new `StorageClient` class for local file operations
  - Files stored in `./attachments/` directory structure
  - Organized by email ID: `emails/{email_id}/attachments/{attachment_id}/{filename}`
  - Added metadata files for each attachment
  - Implemented file size limits and safety checks
  - Added cleanup functionality for old attachments

### 3. Environment Configuration
- **File**: `env.example`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed S3/MinIO configuration options
  - Added local storage configuration:
    - `STORAGE_PROVIDER=local`
    - `STORAGE_PATH=./attachments`
    - `STORAGE_MAX_SIZE=104857600` (100MB)
  - Updated database URL to SQLite format

### 4. Models Update
- **File**: `models.py`
- **Change**: Updated EmailAttachment model for local storage
- **Details**:
  - Changed default `storage_provider` from 's3' to 'local'
  - Made `storage_bucket` nullable since it's not used for local storage
  - Updated comments to reflect local file path usage

### 5. Frontend Improvements
- **File**: `templates/index.html`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced email detail view with better formatting
  - Added support for HTML email content display
  - Improved CC/BCC recipient display
  - Added priority indicators
  - Enhanced action buttons with star and flag functionality
  - Better email content rendering with proper line breaks
  - Added toggle functions for star and flag operations

### 6. Dependencies
- **File**: `requirements.txt`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `psycopg2-binary` (PostgreSQL driver)
  - Removed `boto3` (AWS SDK)
  - Kept all other dependencies for core functionality

### 7. Directory Structure
- **Added**: `./attachments/` directory for storing email attachments
- **Structure**:
  ```
  attachments/
  ├── emails/
  │   └── {email_id}/
  │       └── attachments/
  │           └── {attachment_id}/
  │               ├── {filename}
  │               └── {filename}.meta
  └── temp/
  ```

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Simplified Deployment**: No need for PostgreSQL or cloud storage services
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: Fewer external services to manage
3. **Cost Effective**: No cloud storage costs
4. **Better Performance**: Local file access is faster than network requests
5. **Easier Development**: All data stored locally for easier debugging
6. **Enhanced UI**: Better email formatting and user experience

## Setup Instructions

1. **Copy Environment File**:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. **Update IMAP Configuration**:
   Edit `.env` file and update:
   - `EMAIL_USER`: Your email address
   - `EMAIL_PASS`: Your app password
   - `IMAP_SERVER`: Your IMAP server (e.g., imap.gmail.com)

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize Database**:
   ```bash
   python -c "from app import app, db; app.app_context().push(); db.create_all()"
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## File Structure
```
vexmail/
├── app.py                 # Main Flask application
├── models.py              # Database models
├── storage_client.py      # Local storage client
├── templates/
│   └── index.html        # Frontend interface
├── attachments/          # Local attachment storage
├── instance/
│   └── vexmail.db       # SQLite database
├── .env                  # Environment configuration
├── env.example           # Environment template
└── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
```

## Notes

- The application now uses SQLite which is included with Python, eliminating the need for PostgreSQL
- All attachments are stored locally in the `./attachments` directory
- The frontend has been improved with better email formatting and user interactions
- All core functionality remains the same, just with simplified infrastructure
- Redis is still used for caching and Celery task queue (can be removed if not needed)
